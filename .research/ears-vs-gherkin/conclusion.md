# EARS vs Gherkin — Conclusion

## Last updated

June 2026

## Question

What are the differences between EARS and Gherkin, and when should each be used?

## Verdict

EARS and Gherkin operate at **different layers of the requirements stack** and are complementary,
not competing. EARS is for writing *system requirements*; Gherkin is for writing *executable
acceptance scenarios*. The strongest workflow uses both in sequence: EARS defines what the system
shall do, Gherkin specifies how to verify it.

## Confidence

High. Multiple independent sources confirm this framing, and tooling exists for automated
EARS→Gherkin conversion, validating the layered model in practice.

## Strongest supporting evidence

- EARS was explicitly designed for systems engineering across software and non-software domains;
  it produces formal "shall" statements independent of any test tooling.
- Gherkin is directly executable via Cucumber/SpecFlow/Behave and serves as living documentation
  — spec and test stay in sync by definition.
- Tools like RequireKit and Spec Format Converter automate EARS→Gherkin translation, confirming
  the two formats map to distinct but adjacent concerns.
- EARS has been validated in embedded/PLC contexts (IEC 61131-3) where Gherkin tooling does not apply.

## Strongest weakening evidence

- In practice, Gherkin's BDD promise ("business writes the tests") rarely holds; stakeholder
  involvement is often low, making Gherkin's communication advantage theoretical.
- EARS reduces structural ambiguity but does not eliminate semantic vagueness — poorly chosen
  words still produce ambiguous requirements.

## What is not supported

- That one format replaces the other across all contexts.
- That Gherkin is suitable for hardware or non-software requirements.
- That EARS requirements can serve directly as executable tests without translation.

## Where evidence is thin

- Quality and completeness of AI-assisted EARS→Gherkin translation for complex multi-keyword
  EARS patterns is not yet benchmarked.
- NFR coverage (performance, security, availability) is weak in both formats.

## What to check again later

- ANMS adoption and whether it supersedes standalone EARS/Gherkin for AI-assisted development.
- Whether AI code generation tools (Copilot, Cursor, Claude Code) prefer one format for
  spec-to-code pipelines.

## Quick reference

| Dimension | EARS | Gherkin |
|---|---|---|
| Layer | Requirements | Acceptance specification / test |
| Primary audience | Systems engineers, REs, architects | Dev, QA, product owners |
| Tooling required | None | Yes (Cucumber et al.) |
| Executable | No | Yes |
| Domain | Software + non-software | Software only |
| Ambiguity control | Structure (syntax), not semantics | Concrete examples reduce ambiguity |
| Maintenance cost | Low | Medium–high (depends on abstraction) |

## When to use EARS

- Writing formal SRS/system requirements for audit or compliance
- Domain includes hardware, embedded systems, or non-software components
- Team includes non-developers who must read and approve requirements
- You are upstream (requirements phase), handing off to dev/QA for testing

## When to use Gherkin

- Doing BDD with a software-only system
- You want executable acceptance tests derived from business scenarios
- Team is dev+QA-centric with product-savvy stakeholders
- Defining *how to verify* a feature, not just *what it must do*

## When to use both

- Regulated domains (medical, automotive, aerospace) with software components
- You need formal RE traceability *and* executable tests
- Auto-generating Gherkin from EARS using AI or tooling
